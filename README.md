# django-rest-testframework
This project was a POC done to show that Python/Django could be used as a RESTful Testing Framework. The idea was to create a distributed system that utilized REST API communication, thus eliminating the restriction on being tied to a particular Programming Language. This is extremely useful in a Multi-OS environment, or an environment with many separate Testing Tools/Utilities.
