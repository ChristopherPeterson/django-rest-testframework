# django-rest-testframework
This project was a POC done to show that Python/Django could be used as a RESTful Testing Framework. 

The idea was to create a distributed system that utilized REST API communication, thus eliminating the restriction on being tied to a particular Programming Language. This is extremely useful in a Multi-OS environment, or an environment with many separate Testing Tools/Utilities.

It was created a few years ago, using an older version of Django, so it would need to be updated to support Django 1.8.x.
